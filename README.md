## How to Use

    1. If it is initial execution, Go to **'Data'** section, Select your own DLCs and Click **'Create'** button to create your music list data.
2. Set filter as you want.
3. Press **F7**. (actually it runs at releasing key, not pressing key because of preventing multiple runs.)

## FAQ

* Q. When I pressed F7, the screen freezes for a moment and then it just steps down once.
